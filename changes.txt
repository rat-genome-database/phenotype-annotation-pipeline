   NEW FORMAT (genes_to_phenotype.txt)
     #Format: entrez-gene-id [tab] entrez-gene-symbol [tab] HPO-Term-ID [tab] HPO-Term-Name [tab] Frequency-Raw [tab] Frequency-HPO [tab] Additional Info from G-D source [tab] G-D source<tab>disease-ID for link
     2	A2M	HP:0001300	Parkinsonism			susceptibility	mim2gene	OMIM:104300

Mar 9, 2020
 - refactored annotations qc and load code, for better performance and accurate summary counts

Mar 4, 2020

Mar 9, 2015 - v.1.5.5
 - human HPO annotations 1.2.2: fixed ref_rgd_id for HPO annot pipeline

Jan 23, 2015 - v.1.5.4
 - fixed bug in rgdcore OntologyXDAO.getTermsBySynonym(), so no longer spurious multi OMIM ids will be reported

Sep 2, 2014 - v.1.5.3
 - human HPO annotations 1.2.1: moved hard-coded file names into AppConfigure.xml

Aug 20, 2014 - v.1.5.2

   containing all unmapped OMIM ids supplemented by information from UMLS database

Aug 13, 2014 - v.1.5.1
 - human HPO annotations 1.1.0: improved qc and load statistics; updated jars

Jun 3, 2014 - v.1.5.0

Jan 24, 2013 - v.1.4.4
 - added logging of deleted annotations into deletedAnnots.log

December 28, 2012 - v.1.4.3
 - updated rgdcore.jar: unique index on FULL_ANNOT table no longer has fields TERm and EXP_RGD_ID    - per RGDD-555

August 23, 2012 - v.1.4.3
 - updated rgdcore.jar: unique index on FULL_ANNOT table no longer has fields TERm and EXP_RGD_ID

June 19, 2012 - v.1.4.2
 - added AnnotationImportDAO wrapper to hold all DAO code;
 - got rid of one of bottlenecks: greatly reduced number of calls to AnnotationImportDAO.getObject()
   by using local object cache
 - refactored (simplified) code for testing if annotation is already in database (uses new methods from rgdcore)
 - annotations will have added 'PMID:' prefix when storing them in database

May 4, 2012 - v. 1.4.1:
 - added detailed logging, to both 'status' and 'core' logs, about a term accession not matching a term
   in RGD database -- probably reloading of MP ontology will be sufficient to fix the problem
